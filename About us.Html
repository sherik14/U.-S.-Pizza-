                <h3>Mr. Sohil Makhani: A Visionary for Affordable Quality Food in Angola</h3>
                <p>
                    Mr. Sohil Makhani, a resident of Luanda, Angola, has dedicated his life to bringing better food options to the community. 
                    At 44 years old, he brings over 25 years of experience living in Africa, having moved to Angola from the Congo in 2005.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea for U.S. Pizza was born out of his frustration with the local fast-food market. In his words, 
                    "A small burger and a slice of pizza would cost about $65, and even at that price, the quality was disappointing." 
                    Determined to change this, Mr. Makhani opened U.S. Pizza on December 22, 2023. His mission is simple yet profound: 
                    to provide high-quality, delicious, and affordable fast food that everyone can enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Makhani recognizes the need for modern, innovative marketing and an expanded market scope to bring U.S. Pizza to more people. 
                    This website reflects his vision to connect with a broader audience, offering a convenient platform for customers 
                    to explore the menu, stay updated on the latest offers, and engage with the restaurant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a strong foundation and clear goals, U.S. Pizza aims to become a household name in Angola's fast-food industry, 
                    driven by Mr. Makhani's unwavering passion and dedication.
